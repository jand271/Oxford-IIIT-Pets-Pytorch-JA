# Why is this repository a fork?
While this repository is a fork, we only used the dataset from the parent repository.
But that [dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) was actually created by Oxford researchers O. M. Parkhi, A. Vedaldi, A. Zisserman, C. V. Jawahar,
and they allow its use under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/),
so we are not sure why the author of the parent repository violated the terms of the license of the dataset
and added his own license instead without any attribution to the authors of the dataset, although he did not modify the dataset.
Nevertheless, we are retaining the license he had added with a file name that clarifies that we did not use any of his code.


## Sections
Because of the unique circumstances concerning this repository, 
we are moving the README to the [Wiki](https://github.com/jand271/Oxford-IIIT-Pets-Pytorch-JA/wiki) instead.
