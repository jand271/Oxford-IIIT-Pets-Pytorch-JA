# Why is this repo a fork?
While this repository is a fork, we only used the dataset from the original repository.
The dataset was actually created by https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/,
and they allow its use under the Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/),
so we are not sure why the author of the repo we forked the dataset from violated the terms of the Creative Commons License, 
but added his own license instead without any attribution to the authors of the dataset (O. M. Parkhi, A. Vedaldi, A. Zisserman, C. V. Jawahar). 
Nevertheless, we are retaining the license he had added, although we did not use any of his code.


## Sections
Because of the unique circumstances regarding this fork, we are moving the README to the [Wiki](https://github.com/jand271/Oxford-IIIT-Pets-Pytorch-JA/wiki) instead.
