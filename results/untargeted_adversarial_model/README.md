## How to interpret results?

This directory has 294 images, and a set of 3 images comprise of an input image,
adversarial noise (generated by the Adversarial noise generator) added to it, and the resulting "perturbed" image.

eg. `epoch_5_perturbed_image_0.png` is the "perturbed" image.
`epoch_5_original_image_0.png` is the original input image, from which this perturbed image was generated after
`epoch_5_adversarial_noise_0.png` was added to it.

[change_in_labels](https://github.com/jand271/Oxford-IIIT-Pets-Pytorch-JA/blob/master/results/untargeted_adversarial_model/change_in_labels) depicts what the initial label was, and what it was switched to.


## <i>"Sweet! What am I looking for, though?"</i>
Most of the perturbed images have quasi-human-imperceptible perturbations that caused a ResNet50 model pre-trained on the Oxford-IIIT pets dataset to misclassify.


## How to reproduce this experiment
Similar images can be reproduced by running the following
```
python untargeted_attack_adversarial_model.py --known_config_mode
```
The generated images may not be same because Optuna may change the random seed, although we fixed it.

## Summary

`Perturbed image = Original image + Adversarial noise`

Note that only 4 of these images have tiny modifications that human eyes can perceive,
but some images do not have any perceptible perturbations whatsoever.

However other such as the ones below have readily noticeable perturbation.
